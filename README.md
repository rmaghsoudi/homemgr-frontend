# HomeMgr

   Welcome to your personal Home Manager! You'll be able to manage chores, groceries, and occupants. You can create new chores and assigning an occupant to that chore; as well as finding and adding groceries to your list to keep track of your supplies. This app was made with ReactJS, Redux, and Materialize for the frontend; It also utilizes a custom Ruby on Rails API on the backend as well as an external Food API, made by Spoonacular, for the grocery search.

You can add a grocery by searching it by name, defining a quantity, and selecting the appropriate category. Once you search, results will render on the page after it sends your query to the Food API. You can then select the desired grocery and it'll be added to your page.![Groceries Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43018235/64891294-8853fc80-d63f-11e9-95f9-9217b47e8b26.png)
